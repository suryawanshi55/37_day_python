DATA TYPES:
1]integers:
 int or integer, is a whole number,positive or negative,without decimals of unlimited length.
 it is represented by %d or %i.
ex-4567890321

2]Float:
 float or floating point number,positive or negative,containing one or more decimals.
 float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
 float can be represented as %f.
ex-x=35e3
   y=12E4
   z=-87.7e100
print(type(x)) #<class 'float'>
print(type(y))#<class 'float'>
print(type(z))#<class 'float'>

3]complex:
 complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part
 a+bj--->complex
ex-x=3+5j
   y=5j
   z=-5j
print(type(x)) # <class 'complex'>
print(type(y)) # <class 'complex'>
print(type(z)) # <class 'complex'>

4]list:
 list can contain several data types.list is represented as []
 in list, index always start from 0 & length will always starts from 1.
 list is mutable,modification cannot be made.list is sequence type.list can hold several data types.
 list collection which is ordered and changeable allow duplicate members.

5]Dictionary:
 dictionary are used to store data value in key:value pairs.empty set {} it is called a dictionary.
 dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable &do not allow duplicate.
 dictionary are written with curyly brackets and have keys and value.set can also be used to perform mathematical set operation like  union,intersection,symmetric difference etc.

6]set:
 collection which unordered,unchangeble & unindexed,no duplicate members.
 set is represented by {} with element inside it but we cannot represented an empty set.
 set contain several data types in it but we cannot have one more set inside it.
 set is mutable,modification can be made i.e we can add & remove from set.but frozenset is immutable.we cannot add & remove element in it.

7]Tuple:
 collection which is ordered & unchangeable allow duplicate members.tuple are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
 tuple are written with round brackets().
 tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in python used to store collection of data,the other 3 are list, set,dictionary all with different qualities and    usage.value with comma it is called tuple.
 to determine how many items a tuple has,use the len() function.tuple items can be of any data types.string,int,boolean data types.

8]bytes:
bytes is the immutable data types.


9]Array:
array used to store multiple value in one single variable.
an array is special variable,which can hold more thanone value at a time.
array element by referring to the index number.
   usethe len() method to return the length of an array(the number of elements in an array).
you can use the for in loop to loop through all the elements of an array.
